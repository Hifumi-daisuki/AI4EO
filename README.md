We add another folder name 'FasterSeg' for new solution.
In terms of the level of creativity and originality, we designed our own neural network architecture for semnatic segemntation of sargassum by nerual architecture searh.

### FasterSeg To do list
- [x] Add FasterSeg results
- [ ] Export the FasterSeg PyTorch Model to ONNX
- [ ] Convert ONNX Model to TensorFlow GraphDef (TF1.x)
- [ ] Use TensorFlow 1.x to Load and Run the Model
- [ ] Test on Movidius neural compute stick
